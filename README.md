# Alphite

Alphite is a simple command-line text editor made for UniCMD (10.0r and up). This project was originally made for use with UniCMD, but it can be easily adapted to run outside of it. Iâ€™ve open-sourced it primarily as an example or base for anyone looking to create their own CLI text editor.

## Features
- It's a text editor man
- Saving files with `Insert`

## Requirements
- .NET 8.0
